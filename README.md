*Huge thanks to [hieuddo](https://github.com/hieuddo) for their effort to get this up and running. There are still a few issues I've noticed with how the repo is updated. While this is a good companion to have, following up with this repo itself is currently the best way to catch up on all IPA releases.*

*Many thanks to [Cleover](https://github.com/Cleover) / [Team](https://github.com/TheResonanceTeam) for their diligent work in providing a functional version of [TrollApps](https://github.com/TheResonanceTeam/TrollApps).*

All files can be found in Releases, either by Ctrl + F searching, or looking at the table to see what date the latest version of an app was released, and finding the corresponding release with a matching date

Releases are made by the day - new day, new release. I make a release one day and edit it throughout the day with new or updated IPAs until the day ends, and then create a new release post by the day and just modify it. This keeps notification spam to a minimum but will mean you might want to wait until the day ends to go through a release to make sure all files are final, since I may make changes throughout the day. Everything is done in the CEST time zone


## Announcements

**(11-28-2023) - (12-14-2023)** All apps reviewed, re-tested, and new ones added for TrollStore 2.

---

**(11-10-2023)** All games have been removed to focus solely on applications.


## Emoji Guide for App Selection *(Status)*

In this repository, you'll find various apps and tweaks that may serve similar purposes. To help you choose the right one, I've added emojis to indicate the status of each app: *(May be subject to change over time.)*

- :white_check_mark: Indicates that an app is working or up-to-date.

- :x: Indicates that an app is either discontinued or not working.

- :warning: Indicates that an app is outdated but still functional.

- :no_entry_sign: Indicates that an app is not Trollstore compatible, and support will not be provided.

- :thumbsup: Indicates that an app or tweak is considered better than another one from the repo. (Example: Paperback > Aidoku)

- :bulb: Indicates that an app contains a hand-made tutorial. (Linked in its description)

- :grey_question: Indicates that the app's original source is inaccessible or has not been tested and its functionality is uncertain.

These emojis should assist you in making informed decisions when selecting apps or tweaks from this repository. Please consider the provided emoji guidance when choosing the right application for your needs.

## Additional Information

- **Crediting Contributions:** Ensuring proper recognition of the hard work put in by the respective maintainers is of utmost importance. It's crucial to acknowledge that I gather and update all the IPAs I have in one central location. This process is carried out with immense respect for the creators, emphasizing that credits are obligatory and placed at the forefront because they reflect the dedication and effort invested by these individuals.

- **TrollStore Apps Compatibility:** In order to clarify, the presence of the term "TrollStore" in the title may lead some individuals to assume that all the applications listed herein are exclusively compatible with TrollStore. This, however, is not the case. Many of the apps featured on this list can indeed function seamlessly when sideloaded. **Edit: As of 28.11, I can offer support for TrollStore. However, in the event of any compatibility issues arising with an application within this environment, I will use alternative methods such as ESign or Sideloadly. My commitment remains steadfast towards delivering a seamless user experience, and I am willing to utilize the required tools and platforms to ensure this outcome.**

- **Reporting Issues:** When opening issues, it's imperative to include details about your device specifications and the versions of the apps you are using. This information is necessary for diagnosing and resolving issues in an effective manner. Without it, identifying the root causes of the problems you encounter can be a challenging task. Please note, however, that **issues that are [duplicates](https://github.com/swaggyP36000/TrollStore-IPAs/issues/84) of existing ones or those filed [without a description](https://github.com/swaggyP36000/TrollStore-IPAs/issues/88) (invalid) will be immediately marked as completed and closed, so ensure your report is both unique and detailed**.

- **Version Column:** The version column in this repository may vary. Sometimes, it will display the base version of the app, and in other cases, it may show a combination of the tweak version and the app version (e.g., [tweak version]-[app version]). Please note that this format is subject to change for each app and update, depending on the developer's or maintainer's preferences.
  
-  **Reposters Notice:** If you intend to download IPA files from sources other than this repository, it's important to note that there is an ongoing problem with Telegram channels, websites, and individuals stealing, reposting, and claiming the work of others as their own. These reposters often remove original credits and add their own channel icons or signatures. To ensure the safety and integrity of the content, this repository will list parties that engage in such practices. Users are encouraged to be cautious and support original creators and maintainers. Expect regular updates to this list, as it is subject to change.

| u0Launcher | *After thinking this over for a couple months, I have elected to include a copy of u0Launcher, but NOT unc0ver itself. Download the latest unc0ver IPA from the [official website](https://unc0ver.dev).* u0Launcher fixes the codesigning issue that some unc0ver users experience when installing unc0ver via TrollStore. Simply install unc0ver, then install u0Launcher, then launch u0Launcher and let it work its magic. Then launch unc0ver and jailbreak freely | 1.0.1 | [opa334](https://github.com/opa334/u0Launcher) | 01-24-2023 | :white_check_mark: |

| Vendetta | **[Vendetta plugins list](https://vd-plugins.github.io/web/#)**. A modified Discord client akin to Enmity for Discord, built upon the foundation of Vencord, I believe. It boasts a distinct set of plugins, although many of the plugins from Enmity are also available on Vendetta. Additionally, Enmity themes can be transferred to Vendetta, although users should anticipate encountering user interface issues during the process.

| Violet | *Another* strictly 18+ NSFW manga reader. App is a bit buggy - let it download the database, then close and reopen if it freezes. You will have to reopen the app after going into some sub-menus bc there's no way out of them (UI bugs).

| VSCO Lion | VSCO, injected with the tweak Lion by Michael Lema. Allows for saving pretty much all media by long-pressing on them. *Few things to note: If you're jailbroken, fully disable tweak injection into VSCO using Choicy. Signing in through Apple and Google don't work (clicking Apple does nothing, clicking Google causes a crash). If you need to sign in this way, create a backup of VSCO from the App Store using either Apps Manager or Crane, depending on if your phone is jailbroken or not, while signed in before installing this ipa through TrollStore. This version also does not include dark mode. All other features should be the same* | 1.4-282.0 | [ipahost](https://github.com/ipahost/Lion-for-VSCO) / [KZStore](https://kzstore.net/)* | 12-03-2022 | :warning: |

| YouTube Elite | *Sign-in fix does not work unless you install with TrollStore. No solution to that so far.* If I'm correctly understanding the description, this is YouTube with DLTube, YouTubeKiller, YouTube Reborn, YouPiP etc. injected *As uYou+ is having video/audio download errors (403), this is currently the best modded IPA for YouTube in existence. This also has multiple toggles in the YouTubeKiller, etc. sections that may fix Google sign-in errors* **Newer versions of this IPA do not include YTKillerPlus.

For future updates, please visit zxcvbn's Telegram: https://t.me/zxcvbn_tweaked. Please do not harass the dev, I only include them as a maintainer since they were the ones that figured this out.* Yes, the long awaited login fix for those attempting to sideload YouTube Elite, thanks to the efforts of zxcvbn | 18.17.2 | [zxcvbn](https://t.me/asdfzxcvbn0) | 05-06-2023 | :x: |
